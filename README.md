FIRST YOU HAVE TO GO TO SPYDER(PYTON3.8) OR ANY PTYHON EXTENSION THAT SUPPORTS THE LIBRARIES AND THEN YOU HAVE TO COPY TRAINING.PY FILE AND APP.PY FILE IN THE SPYDER PYTHON EXTENSION. THEN RUN THE TRAINING.PY IT WILL CREATE THREE FILES AND NEXT RUN THE APP.PY. AFTER TRAINING THE DATA IT WILL GIVE US A URL. BY USING THIS URL WE CAN BE ABLE TO GO TO THE CHATBOT. WE HAVE IMPORTED LIBRARIES SUCH AS FLASK,NLKT,TENSORFLOW,PICKLE AND KERAS. THESE LIBRARIES ARE IMPORTANT FOR RUNNING THE LINES OF CODE. IF ONE LIBRARY IS MISSING THEN IT WILL SHOW ERROR.
